Project: Multi-tier Application Deployment with Kubernetes

Objective:
To deploy a multi-tier application on Kubernetes, consisting of frontend, backend, and database components. The project aims to enhance your understanding of managing complex applications within a Kubernetes environment.

Key Features:

Frontend Deployment:

Deploy a frontend application using a containerized web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
Utilize Kubernetes Deployments and Services to ensure scalability and load balancing.
Backend Deployment:

Containerize the backend application (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask).
Use Kubernetes Deployments to manage the backend pods and ensure high availability.
Database Setup:

Deploy a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) as a Kubernetes StatefulSet to manage stateful data.
Configure persistent storage for the database to maintain data across pod restarts.
Networking:

Implement Kubernetes Services to facilitate communication between frontend, backend, and database components.
Explore Ingress controllers to manage external access and define routing rules.
Secrets Management:

Utilize Kubernetes Secrets to securely manage sensitive information such as database credentials.
Implement a secure way to handle environment variables within the application.
Configuration Management:

Use ConfigMaps to manage configuration settings for the application.
Explore how to dynamically update configurations without redeploying the entire application.
Health Checks and Readiness Probes:

Implement health checks for each component to ensure proper functioning.
Utilize readiness probes to avoid routing traffic to pods that are not yet ready.
Scaling:

Experiment with horizontal pod autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of pods based on resource utilization.
Explore the scaling of individual components based on demand.
Logging and Monitoring:

Implement centralized logging using tools like Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK stack).
Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to track resource usage and application performance.
Backup and Recovery:

Establish a backup strategy for the database, considering periodic backups and recovery procedures.
Explore options for snapshotting persistent volumes to aid in disaster recovery.
Technologies:

Containerization:

Docker for containerizing frontend and backend applications.
Orchestration:

Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
Frontend Framework:

Choose a frontend framework or web server (e.g., React, Angular, Nginx).
Backend Framework:

Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask).
Database:

Choose a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Networking:

Kubernetes Services for internal communication.
Ingress controllers (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller) for external access.
Secrets Management:

Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive information.
Configuration Management:

Kubernetes ConfigMaps for managing application configurations.
Health Checks and Probes:

Kubernetes health checks and readiness probes.
Scaling:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for dynamic scaling.
Logging and Monitoring:

Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK stack) for logging.
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
Backup and Recovery:

Database-specific tools for backup (e.g., mysqldump).
Kubernetes features for persistent volume snapshotting.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to deploy, manage, and scale the multi-tier application on Kubernetes. Include step-by-step guides for setting up each component and troubleshooting common issues.
